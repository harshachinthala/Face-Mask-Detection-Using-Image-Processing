# 😷 Face Mask Detection Using Image Processing & Deep Learning

A real-time **Face Mask Detection System** built using **Deep Learning and Computer Vision** to identify whether a person is wearing a mask or not through images and live webcam feed.  
The system leverages **MobileNetV2**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow** for fast, accurate, and lightweight detection.

## 📌 Project Overview

During the COVID-19 pandemic, enforcing mask compliance in public places became critical.  
This project provides an **automated, low-cost, real-time solution** to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks using cameras.

### Key Highlights
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV DNN  
- Mask / No-Mask classification with confidence score  
- Supports live webcam feed  
- Audio alerts for mask violations  
- Detects multiple faces simultaneously  
- Lightweight CNN using MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
